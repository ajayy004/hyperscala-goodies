## What is it?

Hyperscala is a Scala web framework providing type-safe HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript.  It is 
designed to eliminate the need for and confusion created by special UI templates.  Presentation 
layer content can be rendered completely from Scala sources or read dynamically from files.  

It provides a mechanism to deliver re-usable content in a simple, rich, and modular way. Hyperscala does 
these things without requiring proprietary configuration files and without making decisions for you.
